​	b) Is in 3NF.

​	c) Not in BCNF.

Question 2:

​	a) 	Candidate key: B

​		Not BCNF, Not 3NF.

​		Decomposition: $\{ABCD\} \rightarrow \{BC\} \thinspace and \thinspace \{CAD\}$

​	b)	Candidate key: BD

​		Not BCNF, Not 3 NF.

​		Decomposition:  $\{ABCD\} \rightarrow \{BD\} \thinspace and \thinspace \{BC\} \thinspace and \thinspace \{DA\}$
